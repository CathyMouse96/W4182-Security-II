## Problem 1

**a.** Meltdown: Out-of-order execution. Spectre: Branch prediction or speculative execution.

**b.** Meltdown allows an attacker to dump the entire kernel memory. On Linux and OS X, the entire physical memory is directly mapped to the kernel memory at a certain offset. Thus, attackers can dump the entire physical memory by iterating over the kernel address space. In contrast, Windows maps a large fraction of physical memory to the paged pools, non-paged pools and the system cache. Regions in non-paged pools are required to remain in the memory, while regions in paged-pools can be removed from the memory because a copy already exists on the disk. Therefore, there may be physical pages that are **not** mapped in the kernel address space, and those are the memory regions that cannot be read with Meltdown.

**c.** There are the following differences:

1. Spectre uses **branch prediction** to achieve speculative execution while Meltdown does not. Meltdown relies on the observation that when an instruction causes a **trap**, the following instructions that were executed out-of-order are aborted.
2. Spectre requires **tailoring** to the victim process's software environment while Meltdown does not. Specifically, to launch a Spectre attack, the attacker has to search the binary code and shared libraries of the victim program for instruction sequences and **trick** the CPU into speculatively and erroneously executing these sequences. In contrast, Meltdown does not involve this process.
3. Meltdown exploits a privilege escalation vulnerability specific to **Intel** processors, due to which speculatively executed instructions can bypass memory protection. Consequently, Meltdown only works on Intel processors, while Spectre applies more broadly to CPUs including AMD and ARM processors.
4. Meltdown is mitigated by KAISER, because the KAISER patch implements a stronger isolation between kernel and user space. However, KAISER does **not** protect against Spectre.

## Problem 2

**a.** Canaries are random values added between the return address and the rest of the stack frame. They are inserted whenever a function is called, and their values checked when the function returns. If the value is no longer the same, the program terminates. 

Canaries help protect against buffer overflow attacks because they make it harder for attackers to modify the return address. One main goal of buffer overflow attacks is to make the function return to some address controlled by the attacker. However, to overwrite the return address, the attacker would have to overwrite the canary. Unless the attacker correctly overwrites the value of the canary, which is nearly impossible since the value is different with each execution, they would not be able to redirect the program to the address they specified.

**b.** Integer overflow attacks.

## Problem 3

Return-oriented programming (ROP) works by manipulating the return address to execute code that the attacker wants to execute. It differs from other memory corruption attacks in that the attacker does **not** inject code onto the stack. Therefore, defense mechanisms such as non-executable stack do not prevent against ROP attacks. Since some portions of code will likely be located at fixed addresses, ROP could also circumvent ASLR. However, the attacker will need to overwrite the **return address**, in which case canaries would still be useful in preventing against these attacks.

The attacker may redirect the program to another function in the program, or a library function loaded with the program. For example, the entire libc library will be loaded if the program uses any function in the library. This provides so many functions to utilize! The attacker could also design the stack space so that the functions will receive the arguments that the attacker wants. Furthermore, the attacker could string together a couple of **gadgets**. Instead of returning to predefined functions, the attacker can make the program execute arbitrary code. This is possible because the x86 instruction set is **dense**. This means that any sequence of bytes will have a high probability of being a valid set of instructions. The attacker could look for sequences of bytes that end with the opcode of `ret`, and design the input such that the first gadget would return to the second gadget, the second gadget would return to the third gadgetâ€¦

To summarize, ROP works in the following steps: first, the attacker finds a vulnerable function to feed their input to. Second, the attacker uses `gdb` to look at the disassembly and the addresses of code and data. Third, they design their input based on the information they obtained. Usually, they fill the input buffer with arbitrary values, overwrite the return address to the address of the function/gadget they want to execute, and keep filling up the stack if they want to modify the arguments or to chain functions/gadgets. Finally, they execute the program with their input and have their way.

## Problem 4

Pointer authentication codes (PACs) are authentication codes (e.g. keyed hashes) computed over a pointer (and possibly its **context**) to protect the pointer's integrity. PACs are stored in the unused bits of pointers, based on the fact that the actual address space in 64-bit architectures is less than 64-bits. PACs are inserted into pointers before they are written to memory, and they are verified before the pointers are used.

PACs try to prevent attacks based on memory corruption vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and ROP. In other words, they try to prevent the overwriting of control data in memory (function pointers and return addresses). Sample use cases include stack protection and control flow integrity. PCAs are especially useful when there are size and performance constraints, since they provide validity checking of pointers with minimal size and performance impact.

The Qualcomm PAC does not fully prevent ROP attacks. For example, it is possible for an attacker to collect multiple authenticated pointers bound to different stack addresses, and use these addresses to form a sequence of gadgets to launch an ROP attack.

## Problem 5

1. The **competition** among multiple organizations may negatively impact their focus on security. For example, two group might be competing for the time to market. Each is trying to market sooner than the other, so even if they initially strived to address security, they might overlook security vulnerabilities in their rush.
2. The **interoperability issues** between multiple standards may lead to misuse or insecure configurations. For example, if devices A and B have different authentication standards implemented and they can only communicate when authentication is disabled, users may disable authentication to use their devices.

## Problem 6

**"The Bicho"** is a hardware backdoor for the CAN bus. It supports **multiple attack payloads**, and the attack surface depends on what is exposed on the CAN bus for a specific car. For example, if lights and brakes are exposed on the CAN bus, an attacker may be able to control lights and brakes. Attacks can also be triggered by specific conditions, such as GPS coordinates, speed or fuel level. Furthermore, "The Bicho" can be used against **any** vehicle that supports CAN - regardless of manufacturer or model!

The hardware itself is connected to the CAN bus via the vehicle's OBD-II port, which is often located under the vehicle's steering wheel. This means that an attacker must be able to gain **physical access** to the vehicle to be able to plant the device. After planting the device, the attacker can send commands to the device via **SMS**. This means the attacker can issue commands **remotely** from any geographical location. The payloads are CAN frames, and the two security researchers who presented this backdoor also set up an online CAN frames database for users to look up CAN frames!

## Problem 7

1. Collected data has to be **stored** someplace. The companies that collect data may not be very security-conscious. For example, banking applications are usually security-conscious, but the website of a restaurant might not be. However, the latter also collects users' credit card information. Thus attackers may be able to hack the database and **leak** sensitive information that can be directly used to commit crimes (e.g. banking information).
2. Leaked information, even if not sensitive, may be leveraged for **social engineering**. For example, people may be more likely to click on a link in a phishing email if it is interesting to them.
3. The **specific devices** that users are using may be revealed. For example, there are many photos on social media websites, and there might be photos of users holding their phones. Attackers can then perform attacks targeted at specific devices based on this information.
4. **Location data** is so often collected, even by applications that do not seem to need it. Knowing the location of a user may help an attacker perform **MITM attacks**, for example on Wi-Fi.
5. Another important issue is **physical security**. Although attacks on physical security are not computer-security-related attacks, I consider them relevant because they can be **made easier** by the lack of computer security. For example, if a smart wristwatch for kids collects location data and does not authenticate the server it is transmitting data to, an attacker could make the wristwatch transmit data to their server, and gain the ability to track the kid every minute of the day. Now that's terrifying.
