## Problem 1

The masters of botnets frequently change their IP addresses and domain names to avoid being blocked. Multiple IP addresses are mapped to the same domain name and they are constantly registered and deregistered. Different domain names are generated with the help of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). DGAs may generate thousands of pseudorandom domain names every day. Only a few of these actually exist in domain name servers. The rest, called NXDomains, are the first step to Damballa's detection of working command-and-control (C&C) domains and the malware they used.

To start, Dambella had a long list of NXDomains, gathered from their global visibility of DNS traffic. They used machine learning to identify clusters of NXDomains and tag the clusters as either Known Malicious or Unknown. They then tried to find the domains that resolved to IP addresses. They were able to find nine domains that resolved to two IP addresses. Thus, they have found working C&C domains.

Next, they looked at the WHOIS data for the domains. Four of the domains were registered with a real email address. The email address likely belonged to an unsuspecting user with no ties to the criminal activity. Although they were unable to figure out the identity of the criminals, they found two other domains that were registered with the same email address. They were thus able to find a list of exploit sites and obtain a copy of the malware. By running the malware, they proved that the domains they found were indeed used by the malware.

They then did analysis on the malware to detect its workings. They executed the malware and performed network traffic flow analysis. They found that the malware is installed in the AppData\Roaming folder, enables autostart by adding a registry entry and allows network connections by creating new firewall rules. They also found that the malware reaches out to other infected hosts using P2P. Connecting to C&C domains was only a backup plan that was rarely used and that was why it was hard to detect. The purpose of the malware is to steal banking information and then exfiltrate the stolen information.

## Problem 2

1. Ransomware decreased in general in 2018.
2. Ransomware targeted at mobile devices increased in 2018.
3. Attacks using powershell increased in 2018.
4. The most common general purpose was intelligence gathering and the most common method was through spear-phishing emails.
5. Connected cameras were the most attacked device aside from routers.

## Problem 3

**Machine:** My first choice would be to use a virtual machine. This has two advantages: First, the host would not be affected by the malware. Second, we can easily restore the virtual machine after each run of the malware by replacing its virtual disk, whereas if we use a physical machine, it would take much longer to reinstall.

The downside is that malware can sometimes detect whether it is running in a virtual environment and modify its behavior. In this case, I would use a PC emulator. It is much harder for software to detect if it is running on a PC emulator. And the host can still have complete control over the program.

**System:** Since we don't know what operating system the malware runs on, my choice is to test all common operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS...). I use "common" because I am assuming the malware is targeted toward the general public, and most people will be using these operating systems. If we had any information on the target of the malware (e.g. it was found in some specific company), we will first try to run the malware on the operating system used in the company.

However, it is unfeasible to test all versions of the operating systems. My solution is to only test versions that existed when the malware was first found, because we know the malware is able to run on one of these versions. I would start with the newest version that existed when the malware was first found and then work my way back with previous versions.

**Antivirus Software:** We need to make sure that the malware is able to run, but the malware may also get suspicious if there is no AV software. I think we can first try to run the malware without AV software. Then, if the malware disables itself, we can use AV software with older signatures, so it is likely the malware will not be blocked.

**Internet connectivity:** We don't want the malware to run with full Internet connectivity, because it might spread to other machines on the Internet. My solution is to only enable connections to some IP when necessary.

## Problem 4

1. They map multiple IP addresses to the same domain. This is called fast-flux. DNS must allow this for load balancing and botnets use this to their advantage.
2. They constantly register and deregister IP addresses for a single domain name.
3. They register and deregister IP addresses as the authoritative nameserver for the DNS zone. This is called double-flux.
4. They generate thousands of domains using Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) and only register some of them.
5. They register new domain names once the old ones are taken down. DNS allows people to register domains on demand because it brings profit.

## Problem 5

### Process:

1. Use `binwalk` to analyze the file.
2. Use `upx` to attempt to unpack the file. (Not sure if this has the same function as 1., but worth trying.)
3. Use the `strings` command to extract ascii strings.
4. Hash the file and check it against known hashes.
5. Perform fuzzy hashing on the file with ssdeep.
6. Compute ngrams.

### Results for file1.dms:

`binwalk -Mev file1.dms`

Okay so how about we Google "RecursionExampleDirectory.java"?

https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs307/javacode/codeSamples/RecursionExampleDirectory.java

This file we found contains code like `int minWithout = minWasted(items, itemNum + 1, capLeft);` and defines functions `getSubs()` and `getFiles()`. Seems like file3.dms could be the compiled version of this file… or at least somehow related.

The md5 hash for this file is `9a678ab2abd3f01266ffed483510f352`, as can be seen in the results of `binwalk`.

Lets also perform fuzzy hashing on the RecursionExampleDirectory.java we found on the Internet.

`javac RecursionExampleDirectory.java`

`ssdeep RecursionExampleDirectory.class`

As we can see, the results are VERY similar!!!

```

file4.dms contains both an ELF executable **and** a compiled Java class. Based on the size of the ELF executable, I'm guessing it's the exact same executable as file1.dms. But we'll see.

`upx -d file4.dms`

`strings file4.dms`

The output of this command is the concatenation of the outputs of `strings file1.dms` and `strings file3.dms` with some random strings at the end.

```

Look, the first half of the fuzzy hash for this file is exactly the same as the fuzzy hash for file1.dms! This confirms our suspicion that the first half of file4.dms is the executable from file1.dms.

The byte distribution for file4.dms:

`strings file5.dms`

Outputs random strings that don't mean anything. Hmmm. Are we stuck here?

No. Apparently there's one simple command I forgot: `file file5.dms`

The result? `file5.dms: data`

Okay so it's not an executable. It's a data file. And I want to kick myself for forgetting this command.

The md5 hash for this file is `bbe5aa90260f321b1f055d40ab5ed278`, as can be seen in the results of `binwalk`.

The byte distribution for file5.dms:

![Figure_5](/Users/cmouse/Documents/Columbia Spring 2019/W4182 Security II/hw3/imgs/Figure_5.png)

As we can see, the byte distribution for file5.dms is largely UNIFORM. Therefore it is very likely that file5.dms is an ENCRYPTED file.

### Conclusion

file1.dms is an **ELF executable** written in **C**. It likely does AES encryption and decryption.

file2.dms is an **ELF executable** written in **C**. It likely does AES encryption and decryption.

file3.dms is a **Java class file** written in **Java**. It is likely a modified version of [this file](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs307/javacode/codeSamples/RecursionExampleDirectory.java).

file4.dms is a **concatenation** of file1.dms and a Java class file.

file5.dms is a **data file** that is very likely to be **encrypted**.

file6.dms is a **Python object file** written in **Python**. It is likely related to networking and time.

file1.dms and file2.dms are **similar**. The first half of file4.dms is **identical** to file1.dms.

Note that while all six files have the .dms extension, they are **not** Amiga disk images. That initially had me fooled :-)
