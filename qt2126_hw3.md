## Problem 1

The masters of botnets frequently change their IP addresses and domain names to avoid being blocked. Multiple IP addresses are mapped to the same domain name and they are constantly registered and deregistered. Different domain names are generated with the help of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). DGAs may generate thousands of pseudorandom domain names every day. Only a few of these actually exist in domain name servers. The rest, called NXDomains, are the first step to Damballa's detection of working command-and-control (C&C) domains and the malware they used.

To start, Dambella had a long list of NXDomains, gathered from their global visibility of DNS traffic. They used machine learning to identify clusters of NXDomains and tag the clusters as either Known Malicious or Unknown. They then tried to find the domains that resolved to IP addresses. They were able to find nine domains that resolved to two IP addresses. Thus, they have found working C&C domains.

Next, they looked at the WHOIS data for the domains. Four of the domains were registered with a real email address. The email address likely belonged to an unsuspecting user with no ties to the criminal activity. Although they were unable to figure out the identity of the criminals, they found two other domains that were registered with the same email address. They were thus able to find a list of exploit sites and obtain a copy of the malware. By running the malware, they proved that the domains they found were indeed used by the malware.

They then did analysis on the malware to detect its workings. They executed the malware and performed network traffic flow analysis. They found that the malware is installed in the AppData\Roaming folder, enables autostart by adding a registry entry and allows network connections by creating new firewall rules. They also found that the malware reaches out to other infected hosts using P2P. Connecting to C&C domains was only a backup plan that was rarely used and that was why it was hard to detect. The purpose of the malware is to steal banking information and then exfiltrate the stolen information.

## Problem 2

1. Ransomware decreased in general in 2018.
2. Ransomware targeted at mobile devices also decreased in 2018.
3. Attacks using powershell increased in 2018.
4. The most common general purpose was intelligence gathering and the most common method was through spear-phishing emails.
5. Connected cameras were the most attacked device aside from routers.

## Problem 3



## Problem 4



## Problem 5

### Process:

1. Use `binwalk` to analyze the file.
2. Use `upx` to attempt to unpack the file. (Not sure if this has the same function as 1., but worth trying.)
3. Use the `strings` command to extract ascii strings.
4. Hash the file and check it against known hashes.
5. Perform fuzzy hashing on the file with ssdeep.
6. Compute ngrams.

### Results for file1.dms:

`binwalk -Mev file1.dms`

Apparently the program is written in C and involves AES encryption and decryption. One might notice that it is **extremely** similar to file1.dms. In fact, the only thing missing seems to be that file2.dms does not print anything to stdout.

```

```

Okay so how about we Google "RecursionExampleDirectory.java"?

https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs307/javacode/codeSamples/RecursionExampleDirectory.java

This file we found contains code like `int minWithout = minWasted(items, itemNum + 1, capLeft);` and defines functions `getSubs()` and `getFiles()`. Seems like file3.dms could be the compiled version of this fileâ€¦ or at least somehow related.

### Results for file4.dms:

```

file4.dms contains both an ELF executable **and** a compiled Java class. Based on the size of the ELF executable, I'm guessing it's the exact same executable as file1.dms. But we'll see.

`upx -d file4.dms`

```

Unfortunately file4.dms was not packed by UPX, so this doesn't give us anything.

`strings file4.dms`

The output of this command is the concatenation of the outputs of `strings file1.dms` and `strings file3.dms` with some random strings at the end.

```

Unfortunately file5.dms was not packed by UPX, so this doesn't give us anything.

`strings file5.dms`

Outputs random strings that don't mean anything. Hmmm. Are we stuck here?

No. Apparently there's one simple command I forgot: `file file5.dms`

The result? `file5.dms: data`

Okay so it's not an executable. It's a data file. And I want to kick myself for forgetting this command.

### Results for file6.dms:

Unfortunately file6.dms was not packed by UPX, so this doesn't give us anything.

`strings file6.dms`

Some results worth mentioning:

```
NTP (Network Time Protocol).
UDPI
TimeStampFieldc

selft
namet
default(
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/scapy/layers/ntp.pyR
%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000(
```

Apparently it has something to do with scapy and networking and time. And it's not a far reach to guess that it's a .pyc file. We confirm our guess with the `file` command: `file file6.dms`

`file6.dms: python 2.7 byte-compiled`

### Conclusion

Note that while all six files have the .dms extension, they are **not** Amiga disk images. That initially had me fooled :-)
