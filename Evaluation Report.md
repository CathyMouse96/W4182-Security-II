Requirements for report:

A report consisting entirely incomplete sentences, typing/spelling/grammatical errors and mostly bullet lists in plain text format will receive no or little credit.

A nicely formatted report clearly and thoroughly explaining the reason for each rating/point deduction, what was tested and what code changes were made will receive most or all credit. Consider including tables indicating each test and the result, and including copies or screenshots of terminal output showing correct results or errors.
